##How to run

install all packages needed:
```
npm install
```

run the development server:
```
npm run dev
```

run the prod server:
```
npm run prod
```

run tests:
```
npm run test
```

## time constraints
- not all stats i wanted are displayed
- didnt add a lot of styling, used MUI for base components, if i had more time i would style the components more (the navigation component, the table display, more colors....)
- added tests only for one route
- if i had mor etime i would use different ui library (something like shadcn with tailwind) as it would give me more control on the ui
